Feng: Kids these days, they believe in Duderad's stories. They worry me. I am sensing the beginnings of an kakistocracy. Duderad is not a competent leader. He still lives with hsi mom and he is afraid of small insects. I mean I am too, but I'm only 6. If he comes to power, I fear his regime will lead the kingdom to further ruin. Me? I love the man. I mean, have you seen the way his spirit glows? I was an ardent Duderad enthusiast for all six years of my life. We must destroy this imperfect world to create a utopia! Duderad forever!
