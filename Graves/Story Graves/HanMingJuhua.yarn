The daughter of death that was never meant to be, 
Imprisoned to herself, alone she stood, atop a mountain of enlightenment, 
From her perch above, she paved a trail of corpses with the warriors below, 
She was beyond the kingdom’s comprehension, 
To save the peace, the emperor took his beloved daughter’s life,
She sleeps here, waiting, restless still.
