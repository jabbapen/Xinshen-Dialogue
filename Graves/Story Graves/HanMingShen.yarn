The founding emperor, born from nothing, committed to his kingdom,
Destroyed enemy legions to realize his dream of a utopian theorem,
He was loved by some and feared by all for his violent system.
In his sleep, the conqueror died, succumbing to a painless poison, despite all his divine wisdom,
And so in the end, the devilâ€™s heaven never did come.
