Ying Zheng - Ruthless Han Ming General

title: YingZheng_dialogue
---
The faithful servant, spared by the Conqueror, loyal until the end, 
But when facing a forgotten death, his words of promise vanished,
A vengeful sickness devoured him whole, 
Insignificance was not worth the price of any dream,
Not even his.
